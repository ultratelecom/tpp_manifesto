For over 60 years, Tobagonians have upheld\nthe principle that no external government must do for us\nwhat we can do for ourselves. This foundational belief has\nguided our politics in our pursuit of a prosperous and self-\nsufficient Tobago.\n\nHowever, to truly unlock our island's full economic potential\nand to realise our vision of making Tobago the \"Greatest\nLittle Island on the Planet,\" we must embrace what it\ntruly means to govern our own affairs. This autonomy is\nnot merely a political aspiration; it is a necessity for our\nprogress and prosperity. It is through autonomy that\nwe can facilitate self-governance, allowing us to make\ndecisions that best reflect the needs and aspirations of\nour people.\n\nAutonomy is essential for safeguarding our cultural\nidentity, promoting economic development, and\nenhancing political stability. It strengthens accountability\nand provides us with the tools to address historical\ninequalities that have long hindered our growth. By\ngaining greater control over our own affairs, we can ensure\nthat the unique voice of Tobago is heard and respected.\n\nAs we move forward, let us unite in our pursuit of\nconstitutional autonomy. Let us work together to build\na future where every Tobagonian has the opportunity to\nthrive, where our cultural heritage is preserved, and where\nour island stands as a beacon of progress and innovation.\n\nTogether, we can achieve this vision. Together, we can\nmake Tobago the \"Greatest Little Island on the Planet.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                                Farley Chavez Augustine\n                                                                Political Leader\n                                                                Tobago People's Party\n",

This mandate seeks to establish a shared understanding\n               of development, aligning economic growth with social progress and guiding\n               all policy decisions with clear, core values and targets.\n\n               THE SOCIAL CONTRACT another cornerstone of this mandate, delineates\n               the reciprocal obligations between the Tobago People’s Party (TPP) and the\n               people of Tobago. The compact promises transparency and accountability\n               from a TPP government, while encouraging active citizen engagement in\n               planning and decision-making processes. Together, we share the responsibility\n               for environmental stewardship and invest in education and skills development,\n               fostering a collaborative approach to community development. The expected\n               outcomes are increased public trust in government institutions, higher levels\n               of civic participation, and stronger community ownership of development\n               projects.\n\n               THE STRATEGIC POLICY AGENDA outlines the strategic directions\n               that will guide Tobago's development across all sectors. With five Strategic\n               Policy Focus Areas, this agenda ensures that our priorities and resources are\n               effectively organised and allocated. It emphasises evidence-based policy\n               formulation, regular reviews, and cross-sectoral co-ordination, aligning with\n               both national and international development frameworks. This coherent policy\n               framework will provide clear priorities for resource allocation and measurable\n               objectives with accountability mechanisms.\n\n               OUR GRAND VISION AND DEVELOPMENT AGENDA PRIORITIES\n               break down this vision into 21 specific priorities, each with targets, indicators,\n               and timelines for tracking progress. This roadmap for development over\n               the next 20 years ensures transparency and accountability, with specific,\n               measurable targets for each priority area.\n\n               FINALLY, THE IMPLEMENTATION LOGIC provides a systematic\n               approach to turning plans into reality. Through a 4-stage, 10-step process,\n               we cover governance, planning, execution, and continuous improvement. This\n               co-ordinated execution across all Tobago House of Assembly (THA) Divisions\n               ensures regular monitoring, course correction, and continuous improvement\n               through learning and adaptation.\n\n               Together, these pillars form a resilient framework, a Strategic Development\n               Planning Pathway, for making Tobago the “Greatest Little Island on the\n               Planet.”\n\n               This manifesto is not just a document; it is a call to action for every Tobagonian\n               to join in building a prosperous, sustainable, and inclusive future.\n",
